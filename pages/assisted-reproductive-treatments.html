        <p class="support_services_text">You want to have a baby but, sometimes, Nature has other plans and, no matter
            how
            hard you try, you just don't get
            anywhere. The treatment of infertility and related conditions can be demanding, with many obstacles,
            including
            high
            costs and legal restrictions. There is no need to give up on your dream of becoming a parent. We at DiviaMed
            are
            here to
            help you!

        <p class="support_services_subheader">Why Ukraine?</p>

                    The success rates of our partner clinics equal or even exceed those in the USA and Western Europe.

                    </span>
                    Ukrainian clinics use the latest medical technology, techniques and procedures supported by
                    international certification.

                    </span>
                    Ukrainian has put comprehensive legislation in place that not only guarantees the quality of medical
                    services in all
                    areas, while being less formalized than elsewhere, also follows confidentiality protocols that fully
                    protect the
                    patient, donors and the unborn child.

                    </span>
                    Even when the outlay on travel and accommodation are included, overall costs are likely to be
                    considerably lower than
                    those in your local clinic.

                    The doctors we work with are not only highly professional but are sensitive to the individual and

                    circumstances of each client.

                    <li>Hormone stimulation - the mother is treated to produce the optimum number and quality of eggs
